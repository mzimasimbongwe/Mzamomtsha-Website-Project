What problem your project solves
A lot of people will come to your docs trying to figure out what exactly your project is. Someone will mention it, or they’ll google a phrase randomly. You should explain what your project does and why it exists. 

## A small code example
Show a telling example of what your project would normally be used for. 

## A link to your code & issue tracker
People like to browse the code sometimes. They might be interested in filing bugs against the code for issues they’ve found. Make it really easy for people who want to contribute back to the project in any way possible. 

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)
A lot of people have the same problems. If things happen all the time, you should probably fix your documentation or the code, so that the problems go away. However, there are always questions that get asked about your project, things that can’t be changed, etc. Document those, and keep it up to date. FAQs are generally out of date, but when done well, they are a golden resource. 

## How to get support
Mailing list? IRC Channel? Document how to get help and interact with the community around a project.

Information for people who want to contribute back

People usually have standards for how they expect things to be done in their projects. You should document these so that if people write code, they can do things in the norm of the project.

## Installation instructions
Once people figure out whether they want to use your code or not, they need to know how to actually get it and make it run. Hopefully, your install instructions should be a couple of lines for the basic case. A page that gives more information and caveats should be linked from here if necessary.

## Your project’s license
BSD? MIT? GPL? This stuff might not matter to you, but the people who want to use your code will care about this a whole lot. Think about what you want to accomplish with your license, and please only pick one of the standard licenses that you see around the web.
